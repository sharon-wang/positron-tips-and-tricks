Tips & Tricks from the maintainers of Positron
Sharon Wang & Melissa Barca

September 17, 2025
[MELISSA]

Hello! I’m Melissa and this is Sharon, and we’re two of the developers working on Positron

Through developing Positron, connecting with users in our github repo, and our own personal  experiences using code editors, we’ve collected some tips and tricks to share with you today.
We hope there’s something in here for everyone whether you’ve yet to download Positron or you’ve been following the dailies from the start.
1

Today, we’ve got tips & tricks for…
Personalizing your coding space


Making data exploration more pleasant


Thoughtful pairing with Positron Assistant

[MELISSA]

We’ve organized the tips into three sections:

First, we’ll cover navigating Positron and a few ways you may want to personalize your coding space.

Then, we'll dive into how you can set yourself up for a more pleasant data exploration experience with a closer look at our editing and plotting tools..

Finally, we'll cover some tricks on how to effectively pair with Positron’s AI Assistant – currently available as a Preview Feature – Positron Assistant ’

Set up the essentials
Figure out your comfy layout
Personalizing your coding space
[MELISSA]

Now, let’s begin with personalizing your coding space! 
We'll show you how to effectively navigate through Positron and configure your layout and settings.
3

Command Palette

Run any command, install extensions, toggle settings

Great for discovering what’s possible
Press Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P to open
[MELISSA]

First off, let’s familiarize ourselves with the Command Palette.

The command palette is a text driven interface that allows you to execute almost any action possible in Positron. It’s the gateway to finding and running any command without clicking through menus or memorizing shortcuts. 

It’s fuzzy-searchable so even if you don’t know the exact command name or if you aren’t sure what commands are available, you can type a few words to  see what your options are.

This feature allows you to quickly access many of the other tips and tricks we have for you today. If you’re not already using the command palette daily, this is a great habit to build to help you explore and familiarize yourself with all of Positron’s capabilities.

4

Run command Welcome: Open Walkthrough…
Walkthroughs
>welcome open
  Welcome: Open Walkthrough…
[SHARON]

let’s start building that habit right away

we’ll open up the Command Palette

and run the command “Welcome: Open Walkthrough”
5

Run command Welcome: Open Walkthrough…
Walkthroughs
>welcome open
  Welcome: Open Walkthrough…
Then type “migrating” and select a walkthrough
[SHARON]

then, we’ll type “migrating” and open up one of these walkthroughs

6

Walkthroughs
VS Code to Positron

RStudio to Positron
[SHARON]

and the selected walkthrough will open up in Positron. Here’s a peek at what they look like
If you’re a VS Code or RStudio user, these help you migrate over and get situated in Positron
7

Layout
Looking for a four pane data science layout?
image from https://positron.posit.co/layout.html#basic-overview 
Run command View: Stacked Layout
>view stacked
  View: Stacked Layout
[SHARON]

next up, let’s talk about your IDE layout
if you’re coming from RStudio, you might be looking for a four-pane data science layout
To get this layout, run the command “View: Stacked Layout”...
…

8

Layout
Looking for a four pane data science layout?

Run command View: Stacked Layout
Files
Plots
Variables
Code
Console
[SHARON]

…and you’ll be set up with your files, code editor, variables, console, and plots all in one view

9

Layout
For even more customization…
Run command Customize Layout… or search for view layout
[SHARON]

for even more customization, check out the “Customize Layout…” command
or, here we search for “view layout” via the Command Palette for even more layout options


10

Interpreter Picker
Indicates the active Console session and helps us populate the Variables
[SHARON]

Now, let’s jump over to the interpreter picker in the top-right of Positron
The picker shows the interpreter for the active Console session
The active session provides the data you see in the Variables pane
the picker is especially helpful when you have multiple console sessions going, so you can tell which session is currently active
11

Console
Multiple R and Python sessions are possible!
[SHARON]

speaking of multiple sessions…here’s how you can create them for various R and Python runtimes
From the Console, click on the “plus” button to create an additional session with the active interpreter
or pictured here, you can click into the “plus” button dropdown to use a different interpreter

12

Console
Right-click to rename sessions

Feel free to use emojis ✨
[SHARON]

if you’ve got a few consoles going, it can get confusing which console is for what!
to alleviate this possible confusion, right-click on a session to rename it
if you want, you can even include emojis!


13

Console
Click on the info icon for more details about your session

[SHARON]

one more console tip…
if you click the info button for a console session, you’ll see metadata about the session, such as 
the interpreter path
as well as quick links to relevant output channel logs
For more on Multi-Console, Dhruvi Sompura has a talk about this in the Lightning Talks session later today!
14

Custom Keybindings
Run command Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts
>keyboard
Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts
[MELISSA]

Up next we have keybindings.

You’re likely already familiar with what a keybinding is, but let’s define it as the association of a specific key or combination of keys with a command.

To get to the keybindings UI, run the command “Preferences: open keyboard shortcuts”

…
15

Custom Keybindings
Assign any Command Palette command to a hotkey

Run command Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts
>keyboard
Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts
[MELISSA]

You can bind any command you can open in the Command Palette.

When you find yourself using the same command frequently, check if a keybinding exists for that command and add one if it does not.

The simplest way to do this it to use the Keyboard Shortcuts editor



16

Add more complex keyboard shortcuts to the keybindings.json file

Custom Keybindings
Run command Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
>keyboard json
Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
[MELISSA]

For more granularity, you can edit keybindings.json directly. Run the command “Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts JSON” to pull up the file.

For example, There is a built-in command called runCommands that allows you to execute a chain of commands from a single keybinding. 

17

Use built-in runCommands to chain actions together (e.g. restart the terminal)

Custom Keybindings
Run command Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
>keyboard json
Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
[MELISSA]

In this snippet I use runCommands to chain together the kill terminal and new terminal commands, to create a quick way to restart my terminal.

I used the when clause to limit this binding to only activate when my focus is in the terminal, leaving the keyboard combination available for other scenarios.

Editing and Authoring with more fluidity
Making data exploration more pleasant
[MELISSA]

Now that you’ve learned some ways to personalize your Positron setup, let’s dive into tips for exploring your data.

19

Data Explorer
View your data in a friendly interface
Summary  Panel
Data Grid
Filter Bar
[MELISSA]

First up, let’s talk about the Data Explorer.

The interface is divided into a filter bar, data grid, and  summary panel.

The summary panel shows each column’s name, its data type, and the percentage of missing values. It even includes a small histogram 
You can view data frames you’ve loaded into your session variables, but you can also…

20

Data Explorer
Click to view your data files in the Data Explorer

data.csv open in the Data Explorer
[MELISSA]

Click on your data file in the file explorer and view it automatically in the data explorer


21

Data Explorer
Compressed data files open just as smoothly



customers-100000.csv.gz open in the Data Explorer
[MELISSA]

You can do this with compressed files as well. No manual unzipping required.

[SHARON]

what if I just want to see the raw CSV file?
22

Content subheader
Bullets get smaller
And smaller
And smaller
Data Explorer
Open plain text as well

[MELISSA]

…as we see here, viewing your plain text file is also as simple as the click of a button. 

You can easily open two tabs and switch between the data explorer and raw text file.

The data explorer watches your source, so if you change the CSV file you’ll see the results reflected instantly, allowing you to quickly iterate on your work. 


If you’re interested in learning more about the data explorer, stick around for Wes McKinney's talk, “Exploring Datasets in Positron”
23

Has this ever happened to you?
😵‍💫
😵‍💫
😵‍💫
[SHARON]

*click slide for emojis*

now…have you ever found yourself lost in a sea of editor tabs, trying to find that one file?

you’re scrolling back and forth through all the file tabs and you’re starting to forget which file you’re even looking for

wouldn’t it be nice if your most important files could just be pinned, so you don’t lose them?

Some good news…

24

Pinned editor tabs
Right-click on an editor tab and select Pin
how to pin a tab
also this setting workbench.editor.pinnedTabsOnSeparateRow
[SHARON]

You can pin editor tabs, whether they’re code files, the Settings tab,  or a Data Explorer you want easy access to

Just right-click on the editor tab and click Pin…
25

Pinned editor tabs
Right-click on an editor tab and select Pin
📌
[SHARON]

and those tabs will be pinned to the beginning of your open editors!

[MELISSA]

So I really love this feature, but sometimes I still feel like I’m getting lost in a sea of my PINNED editor tabs

[SHARON]

well, you may want to reevaluate which ones you REALLY need
26

Pinned editor tabs
Keep pinned tabs on a separate row
how to pin a tab
also this setting workbench.editor.pinnedTabsOnSeparateRow
In Settings, search for and enable Workbench > Editor: Pinned Tabs on Separate Row
[SHARON]

But! In the meantime,

for a bit more pinned tab space

search for the “Pinned Tabs on Separate Row” setting and enable it…

…

Pinned editor tabs
Keep pinned tabs on a separate row
how to pin a tab
also this setting workbench.editor.pinnedTabsOnSeparateRow
In Settings, search for and enable Workbench > Editor: Pinned Tabs on Separate Row
[SHARON]

…and your pinned tabs will sit above your other tabs
28

Plots
Looking for more real estate for your plots?


🧐
[SHARON]

On to plots…

do you ever wish you could open up your plot in a larger space?

maybe you want to see the iris dataset in fullscreen?
29

Plots
Looking for more real estate for your plots?


Open plots in a new window or an editor tab for a larger viewing area
[SHARON]

You can do so by clicking on this button in the Plots Pane to open the plot in a new window or editor tab
30

✨ spontaneous theme change!
[SHARON]

alright, spontaneous theme change!!

let’s switch over to Positron Dark here…

[MELISSA]
and oh uhhh…hmmm.. this plot is so bright, it’s ruining my dark mode now
31

✨ spontaneous theme change!
🫣
[MELISSA]

and oh uhhh…hmmm.. this plot is so bright, it’s ruining my dark mode now

[SHARON]

this is what your plot will look like if you export it as an image

but! during your authoring and editing process, we can de-ruin your Dark Mode 
32

Set the dark filter setting to Dark Filter for dark plots always, or set the filter to Follow Theme
Plots
🫣
[SHARON]

by clicking on this circle button in the Plots pane!
this allows you to configure whether plots should have a filter applied to them
by default, No Filter is applied, but you can configure this to Follow your Theme, or you can opt-in to dark filtered plots all the time!
so let’s go ahead and choose “Follow Theme”
33

Set the dark filter setting to Dark Filter for dark plots always, or set the filter to Follow Theme
Plots
😌
[SHARON]

and with that, all is well now

[MELISSA]

Agreed, much better!
34

Enhancing your analysis with AI
Thoughtful Pairing with Positron Assistant
[MELISSA]

With that, let’s move on to  talking about effectively pairing with Positron Assistant.


35

An AI client providing LLM integration in Positron

Chat and inline completions

Great for help with debugging, refactoring, and getting suggestions for next steps

What is Positron Assistant?
[MELISSA]

Positron Assistant is an AI client that provides LLM integration with Positron through chat and inline completions. 

It’s great for help with debugging, refactoring, or getting suggestions for next steps in your projects. 

Two concepts to understand to make the best use of Assistant are context and tools.

36

Context beyond files on disk
Aware of active console/runtime
Aware of structure of in-memory objects
Ask questions about your variables and console session
[MELISSA]

Context refers to the information Positron Assitant provides to the LLM alongside your prompt. 

Positron Assistant provides context about files and folders, and it also provides dynamic in memory data from your session.

This includes your loaded variables, plots pane, active console session, and session state. With your permission, assistant can even run code directly in your active session.

You can take advantage of this context by asking assistant to plot data frames for you or tweak things like the title or axis labels on  your plots.

37

Click the eye icon to enable or disable session context
Configuring access to session context
Asking about the current plot with Console session enabled in context
[MELISSA]

You can view what context Assistant is providing to the LLM in your chat context.

Here we ask Assistant about the current plot with the console session enabled as context. Assistant has access to review the code that generated the plot, as well as the plot image itself.
The open eye icon indicates that the context is visible to assistant.

[SHARON]

What if I want my session context to be INVISIBLE to assistant?

[MELISSA]

You can control what context PA sends to the LLM. Whether you have security concerns or the session is irrelevant to your prompt, you can disable it as context by clicking the eye icon. 
38

Asking about the current plot with Console session disabled in context
Click the eye icon to enable or disable session context
Configuring access to session context
[MELISSA]

In this example, we’ve removed access to the console session context.

Assistant is aware that you have a plot in your session, but cannot view the plot, nor see the code that led to the creation of the plot

39

opt-out of including session; add additional files, info to session, you can also attach a commit to your context
Adding more context
Click the 📎 Add Context… button in the chat input box to attach context to your request

[MELISSA]

Providing relevant contextual information can yield better results from the AI models and there may be even more context you want to provide to Assistant

Click the Add Context button to attach additional context such as  files and folders or even additional interpreter sessions.
40

Retrieve helpful context to include with your prompt
Tools
[SHARON]

Much of this context is passed to the LLM through tool calling.

For example, if you ask a question about the current plot, Positron Assistant will call the “get plot” tool, so that the active plot image can be included with your question

Without the get plot tool, the AI model isn’t able to see your plot
41

Look for a green checkmark, which denotes that a tool call has been made
Tools
👁️
[SHARON]

You can tell when Assistant calls a tool

by keeping an eye out for this green checkmark,

followed by some text describing an action

like “Viewed the active plot” in this case
42

Click the 📎 Add Context… button in the chat input box to attach context to your request

Then, click the 🛠️ Tools… option to view the tools available as attachments
opt-out of including session; add additional files, info to session, you can also attach a commit to your context
Attaching tools as context
[SHARON]

By default, Assistant will call tools that seem relevant to your prompt

However, it can be helpful to attach tools as context, if you want Assistant to utilize specific tools with your prompt

First, click “Add Context” in the chat

Then click “Tools” to pick a tool

43

Tool: Help with R Packages and Vignettes
Get help which directly references package documentation and vignettes
[SHARON]

Let’s take a look at a couple other tools available with Positron Assistant

The “Get an R Help Page” tool looks at your current R session and loaded packages to retrieve help and vignettes content for a package

The AI model is provided with this content, so you get guidance DIRECTLY based on the package’s documentation
44

Git integration
Ask Assistant to explain the git tracked #changes you’ve made to your files

[SHARON]

Another tool Positron Assistant provides is the “Get changed files” tool, which retrieves your file modifications from git

To invoke this tool, include #changes in your message to assistant.

For example, here we’ve asked “tell me about the #changes I’ve made”

[MELISSA]

Wait so if assistant can understand my changes, does that mean it can just write my commit message?

[SHARON]

yeah! you could ask “generate a commit message for my #changes”
45

Git integration
From the Source Control tab, click the ✨ sparkles icon to generate a commit message

[SHARON]

or, here, we’ve added axolotl and kangaroo to our code

and from the source control panel

we’ve clicked the sparkles in the commit message box

and Positron Assistant has generated the commit message for us
46

Git integration
Attach a commit as context to get a summary or explanation of the changes

[SHARON]

Calling back to attaching context, you can select “Source Control..” and choose a specific commit to include with your message
Sometimes, a lot of code can change in a commit, or maybe the commit modifies code you’re unfamiliar with
You can attach the commit as context, and ask Assistant to help you understand or summarize the changes
47

Positron Assistant
To try Positron Assistant, enable the positron.assistant.enable setting

🔗 positron.posit.co/assistant
Preview 
[SHARON]

With these tips in mind, we welcome you to try out Positron Assistant, which is currently in preview

To use Positron Assistant, you’ll need to enable the positron.assistant.enable setting in Positron
